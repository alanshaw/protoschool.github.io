Unlike our other tutorials, this one is\\ncode-free and designed especially to introduce you to some of the key terms you'll\\nencounter throughout ProtoSchool.\\n\\nLet's get started!\\n\\n\\n## What are data structures?\\n\\nWhether you're a programmer or not, you're surrounded by data structures every day. Lists, dictionaries, and catalogs all help us organize information and take into account the relationships between various pieces of data.\\n\\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):\\n\\n> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\\n\\nIn programming, data structures are everywhere. The way you organize data into variables in order to use them in programs involves anywhere from dozens to millions of data structures. If you're a developer, you're probably familiar with common data structures like arrays, objects, graphs, etc.\\n\\n## Decentralized data structures\\n\\nOn the decentralized web, where we access data directly from our peers rather than\\nfrom a central authority, we need specialized data structures that allow us to verify\\nand link between various pieces of content.\\n\\nData structures shared through decentralized systems need to be **verifiable**. On a single system such as your own laptop, you have a much greater degree of trust in the data structures you work with in memory\\nor on disk. But in a decentralized system you have less, or possibly zero, trust among peers.\\n\\nLarge data structures must also be able to be spread out among many peers and **linked together** to allow for decentralization. In the same way that any web page can link to another web page\\nin a different location, decentralized data structures enable a web of interlinked data.\\n\"","module.exports = \"---\\n    title: \\\"Working with files in ProtoSchool\\\"\\n    type: \\\"file-upload\\\"\\n---\\n\\nAs a matter of security, web browsers don't let us directly change files that live in your computer's file system. Therefore, you'll need to upload one or more files to the browser that you can use throughout this tutorial.\\n\\nWithin each challenge, you'll see that you can upload files from your computer either by dragging and dropping or selecting them from your file explorer. If you look closely at the `run` function in the code editor, you'll notice that it now takes an argument `files`. When you upload files from your computer, we'll make sure they're passed into the function as the `files` array. As long as you don't refresh your browser, these files will remain accessible for the next lesson in the tutorial, but you'll also have the option to upload different files to work with for each lesson.\\n\\nEach element in this `files` array will be a `File` object, as defined by the browser's [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) (not to be confused with the IPFS Files API). Aside from the contents of the uploaded file, a `File` object also contains the following attributes:\\n\\n* **name** (name of the uploaded file)\\n* **lastModified** (date the uploaded file was last modified)\\n* **size** (size of the uploaded file)\\n* **type** (type of the uploaded file)\\n\\nTo practice, let's upload one or more files from your computer and take a look at what's been received by the browser as the `files` array.\\n\"","import { logFiles } from '../../utils/files'\n\nconst validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  if (!result || typeof result.length === 'undefined') {\n    return { fail: 'Looks like you forgot to return a result.

This kind of traversal could be used to create an overview page that lists all blog posts chronologically.\\n\\nThe `prev` field contains a link to the previous blog post. You can use that CID and the [`ipfs.dag.get`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/DAG.md#dagget) API to get the previous blog, and then use its `prev` field to get the one before that. A perfect use case for a while loop!\\n\\nNote that the `ipfs.dag.get()` API returns an object with a `value` attribute which is the node you want and contains the original fields you saved. For example, we could find the author of the post about dogs like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst dogPostAuthor = (await ipfs.dag.get(dogPostCid)).value.author\\n```\\n\\nNotice the parentheses used around `await ipfs.dag.get(dogPostCid)` above, since the async function needs to complete before the CID object with a property of `value` is available. When you're using this code in practice, it's important not to make too many async calls that will create lag time.\\n\"","const validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  // Learn about working with uploaded files:\n  // https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/README.md#work-with-uploaded-files-for-file-upload-lessons-only\n  let uploadedFiles = window.uploadedFiles\n\n  if (!uploadedFiles) {\n    return { fail: 'You need to upload some files first' }\n  }\n  if (result) {\n    return { success: 'Happy Message!' }\n  } else {\n    return { fail: 'Sad but useful message :(' }\n  }\n\n  /*\n    There are some additional options you can find useful:\n\n    If you want to show some data or result to the user, it's possible to add an additional step after submitting the code:\n    https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/blob/code/README.md#display-results-to-the-user-optional\n\n    If you want to catch external errors and override them to display a more user-friendly error message:\n    https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/blob/code/README.md#override-external-error-messages-optional\n  */\n}\n\nconst code = `/* global ipfs */\n  const run = async (files) => {\n  // Your code here\n}\nreturn run\n`\n\nconst solution = `/* global ipfs */\n  const run = async (files) => {\n  // Your solution here\n}\nreturn run\n`\n\n// for more on the available options:\n// https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/blob/code/DEVELOPING_TUTORIALS.md#lesson-file\nconst options = {\n  overrideErrors: false,\n  createTestFile: false,\n  createTestTree: false\n}\n\nexport default {\n  validate,\n  code,\n  solution,\n  options\n}\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Events.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Events.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","// Question must be a string\nconst question = \"What's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?\"\n\n// Choices must be an array of objects, each with the properties:\n// `answer` (string), `correct` (boolean), and `feedback` (string)\n// Only one answer can be correct.\nconst choices = [\n  {\n    answer: 'Some correct answer.',\n    correct: true,\n    feedback: 'Great job!'\n  },\n  {\n    answer: 'Some incorrect answer',\n    correct: false,\n    feedback: \"Oops.

This [CID (Content Identifier)](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/04), can be used like an address to access the file. If you know a file's CID, you can use the `cat` method provided by the Regular IPFS Files API -- similar to the one you may have seen previously in Unix-style systems -- to retrieve its contents like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.cat(ipfsPath, [options])\\n```\\n\\nAn IPFS `path` can take several forms (you can read about them in the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#cat) documentation). In this lesson, we'll use the simplest one: the `cid` present in the object we receive for a file when the `ipfs.add` method is called. You may remember from the previous lesson that the `add` method returned both `path` and `cid` values for each file you added to IPFS. We'll learn more about the difference between these two values later.\\n\\nThe `cat` method first searches your own node for the file requested, and if it can't find it there, it will attempt to find it on the broader IPFS network. Because of the way cryptographic hashing works, the content you're searching for is guaranteed to match the file found, regardless of which peer is hosting it.\\n\\nThe `cat` method returns an Async Iterable that iterates over the file's chunks of data, i.e. Buffers.\\n\\nA `Buffer` is just a raw collection of bytes and as such doesn't make any assumptions about encodings or the type of data it contains. However, if we know the file being retrieved is a plain text file such as a `.txt`, we can convert its buffered contents to a UTF-8 string (an interpretation of those raw bytes) by calling the JavaScript method `.toString()`.\\n\\nBut since we have multiple buffers of the same file, we need to reassemble them (concatenate) into a single buffer before converting it into a string. The [`it-to-buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/it-to-buffer) package can do just that: iterate over all of the chunks of the file and put them back together for us.\\n\\nSo if you had the CID for a text file in an IPFS node, you could retrieve the file's contents as a readable string like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// the toBuffer variable is globally available (just like ipfs)\\n\\nconst bufferedContents = await toBuffer(ipfs.cat('QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ')) // returns a Buffer\\nconst stringContents = bufferedContents.toString() // returns a string\\n```\\n\\nWhen you're ready to try this in the real world, you should note that the above example can result in heavy memory usage, depending on the contents of the file being read. If you're working with large files and find this to be the case, you might want to skip using the `it-to-buffer` package and instead process each chunk of data iteratively. The main reason IPFS now returns `Async Iterables` is to provide a built-in option for dealing with potential performance issues.\\nIn ProtoSchool tutorials, our code challenges use small files, so we can concatenate everything without worrying about performance.\\n\"","module.exports = \"---\\n    title: \\\"Cryptographic hashing and Content Identifiers (CIDs)\\\"\\n    type: \\\"text\\\"\\n---\\n\\nSo far we've exclusively been discussing adorable images for the sake of our general\\nmerriment, but content addressing can be used on all different types of files and data,\\nfrom JSON objects to term papers to videos. For cryptographic hashing to work, we need\\nto know what data format we're working with and use an appropriate tool.\\n\\n## Decoding data structures\\n\\nA [`CID (Content Identifier)`](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/cid/) is a particular form of content addressing used on the decentralized web. It was developed for\\n[`IPFS`](https://ipfs.io) (a decentralized web protocol which we'll discuss in later tutorials), but has very broad implications.\\n\\nA `CID` is a single identifier that contains both a **cryptographic hash** and\\na **codec**, which holds information about how to interpret that data. Codecs encode and\\ndecode data in certain formats.\\n\\n```\\n+-------+------------------------------+\\n| Codec | Multihash                    |\\n+-------+------------------------------+\\n```\\n\\nMany formats and protocols use content addressing already. Tools like Git and protocols like Ethereum and Bitcoin are among them, but they differ in how to interpret the data and in what cryptographic function they use for hashing. `CID` allows us to create a universal identifier for any of these systems.\\n\\nEvery `CID` is an identifier that contains the [`codec`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) to interpret the data and a [`multihash`](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) which is a self-describing hash (a hash that tells you what type of hashing function was used to create it).\\n\\n```\\n+------------------------------+\\n| Codec                        |\\n+------------------------------+\\n|                              |\\n| Multihash                    |\\n| +----------+---------------+ |\\n| |Hash Type | Hash Value    | |\\n| +----------+---------------+ |\\n|                              |\\n+------------------------------+\\n```\\n\\nFor lots more detail on how CIDs are constructed in IPFS, check out our <a href=\\\"https://proto.school/#/anatomy-of-a-cid\\\">Anatomy of a CID</a> tutorial.\\n\\n## Linking between different data structures\\n\\n`CID`s allow us to build data structures that link to other data structures\\nin completely different formats. Imagine a tree of JSON objects that link\\nto BSON objects that also link to git commits. (Or imagine a directory containing\\npuppy images <em>and</em> kitty videos, with a subdirectory containing articles on\\ngiraffes. The possiblities are endless!) All the way down this tree we\\nhave cryptographic hashes that allow us to distribute and link the data.\\n\\nWhy is it important to link between different data structures?

(Remember,\\nwhen we run data through a cryptographic hash, we get back a \\\"hash\\\" or \\\"content address\\\"\\nthat we can think of as a link, so a Merkle tree is a collection of linked nodes.)\\n\\nAs previously discussed, all content addresses are unique to the data they represent. In the graph above, `node E` contains a reference to the hash for `node F` and `node G`. This means that the content address (hash) of `node E` is unique to a node containing those addresses.\\n\\nGetting lost? Let's imagine this as a set of directories, or file folders. If we run directory E through our hashing algorithm\\nwhile it contains subdirectories F and G, the content-derived hash we get back will include references to those two directories. If we remove directory G, it's like Grace removing that whisker from her kitten photo. Directory E doesn't have the same contents anymore, so it gets a new hash.\\n\\nAs the tree above is built, the final content address (hash) of the root node is unique to a\\ntree that contains every node all the way down this tree. If the data in any node were\\nto change even by a single byte, the hash of the changed node would change, as would the hashes\\nof all of its parent nodes.\\n\\nIn case you haven't noticed, this means that as a programmer you'll always need to build\\nthese data structures backwards, from the leaf nodes on up to the root node.\\n\\n## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)\\n\\n![Directed Acycil Graphs](tutorial-assets/T0001L01-dag.svg)\\n\\nDAG is an acronym for [`Directed Acyclic Graph`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

This means that we can successfully generate a hash for specific content using different hashing algorithms and later on be able to identify content using this hash.\\n\\nBut when we're trying to read the data itself, how do we know the encoding method used?\\nIt could be encoded with CBOR, Protobuf, plain JSON, etc. To solve this issue, `CIDv1` introduces another prefix that uniquely identifies the encoding method used.\\n\\n## Multicodec prefix\\n\\nThe **multicodec prefix** indicates which encoding was used on the data.\\n\\n![Multicodec Prefix](tutorial-assets/T0006L03-multicodec.png)\\n\\nMulticodec supports many different types of encoding, and each has its own short codec identifier, as shown in the [complete table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv).\\n\\nIn the example above we see how data encoded with the codec `dag-pb` would be represented in our CID.\\n`dag-pb` is one of many different types of [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) (InterPlanetary Linked Data) codecs. Because IPFS always uses one of these IPLD formats for its data, **the multicodec prefix in an IPFS CID will always be an IPLD codec**.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that multicodec isn't only used by IPFS and IPLD. Along with multihash and a few other self-describing protocols, it's part of the [Multiformats](https://multiformats.io/) project, which spun off from IPFS and now supports a wide variety of other projects and protocols, including the [CID specification](https://github.com/multiformats/cid) we're learning about here.\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Progress.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=65296500&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Progress.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=65296500&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","/*\n  Error messages to show to the use on the output UI\n */\nexport default {\n  SUCCESS: 'Success!

This has already happened with `sha1`. With time, other algorithms may prove to be insufficient for content addressing in IPFS and other distributed information systems. For this reason, and in order to support multiple cryptographic algorithms, **we need to be able to know which algorithm was used to generate the hash** of specific content.\\n\\n![What is the hashing algorithm used in a hash?](tutorial-assets/T0006L02-what-algo.jpg)\\n\\nSo how can we do this?\\nTo support multiple hashing algorithms, we use **multihash**.\\n\\n## Multihash format\\n\\nA [**multihash**](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) is a self-describing hash which itself contains metadata that describes both its length and what cryptographic algorithm generated it. Multiformats CIDs are future-proof because they use multihash to\\n**support multiple hashing algorithms** rather than relying on a specific one.\\n\\nMultihashes follow the `TLV` pattern (`type-length-value`). Essentially, the \\\"original hash\\\" is prefixed with the `type` of hashing algorithm applied and the `length` of the hash.\\n\\n![Multihash format](tutorial-assets/T0006L02-multihash.jpg)\\n\\n - `type`: identifier of the **cryptographic algorithm** used to generate the hash (e.g. the identifier of `sha2-256` would be `18` - `0x12` in hexadecimal) - see the [multicodec table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) for all the identifiers\\n - `length`: the actual **length** of the hash (using `sha2-256` it would be `256` bits, which equates to 32 bytes)\\n - `value`: the actual **hash value**\\n\\nIn order to represent a CID as a compact string instead of plain binary (a series of `1`s and `0`s), we can use **base encoding**. When IPFS was first created, it used `base58btc` encoding to create CIDs that looked like this:\\n\\n`QmY7Yh4UquoXHLPFo2XbhXkhBvFoPwmQUSa92pxnxjQuPU`\\n\\nMultihash formatting and `base58btc` encoding enabled this first version of the CID, now referred to as Version 0 (`CIDv0`), and its initial `Qm...` characters remain easy to spot.\\n\\nHowever, with time, doubts arose about whether this multihash format would be sufficient:\\n - How do we know what method was used to encode the data?\\n - How do we know what method was used to create the string representation of the CID? Will we always be using `base58btc`?\\n\\nTo address these concerns, an evolution to the next version of a CID was necessary. In the following lessons we'll explore what was added to the specification to lead us to the current CID version: `CIDv1`.\\n\"","import shallowEqualArrays from 'shallow-equal/arrays'\n\nimport utils from './utils.js'\n\nconst validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  if (!result) {\n    return { fail: 'You forgot to return a result :)' }\n  }\n\n  const validatedArray = utils.validateArrayOfCids(result, 2)\n  if (validatedArray.fail) {\n    return validatedArray\n  }\n\n  const TREE_POST_CID = 'bafyreiaahxu4lot4ffzaxnz626kxipxt3lm43lsszcc4q6vydqrwnu7kpi'\n  const COMPUTER_POST_CID = 'bafyreif24ddeqipektksc2jqhulgefwvhwhpylpkmjsdysxygllyeydwqq'\n  if (TREE_POST_CID === result[0].toString() && COMPUTER_POST_CID === result[1].toString()) {\n    return {\n      log: {\n        treePostCid: result[0].toString(),\n        computerPostCid: result[1].toString()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  for (const cid of result) {\n    const obj = await ipfs.dag.get(cid)\n    const node = obj.value\n    if (node.tags === undefined) {\n      return { fail: 'Blog posts need to have a `tags` field.' }\n    }\n    if (!Array.isArray(node.tags)) {\n      return { fail: 'The value of the `tags` field must be an array of strings.' }\n    }\n    const isStrings = node.tags.every((tag) => typeof tag === 'string')\n    if (!isStrings) {\n      return { fail: `Tags need to be strings.` }\n    }\n    let expectedTags\n    switch (node.content) {\n      case 'trees':\n        expectedTags = ['hobby', 'outdoor']\n        break\n      case 'computers':\n        expectedTags = ['hobby']\n        break\n    }\n    if (!shallowEqualArrays(node.tags.sort(), expectedTags.sort())) {\n      return { fail: `The tags of the \\`${node.content}\\` blog post \\`${utils.stringify(node.tags)}\\` did not match the expected tags \\`${utils.stringify(expectedTags)}\\`.` }\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Don't check the CIDs as then the order of the tags would matter.\n  // But that order really doesn't matter.\n  return {\n    success: 'Everything works!',\n    logDesc: 'These are the CIDs of the blog posts.

On the\\n<strong>decentralized web</strong>, we can **all** host each other's data,\\nwith a different kind of linking that's more secure, making it easy to\\ntrust our neighbors.\\n\\n## Cryptographic hashing\\n\\n<strong>[Cryptographic hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)</strong> is the most important tool in the toolbox of decentralized data structures. It opens the door to a new form of linking, known as <strong>content\\naddressing</strong>, that liberates us from reliance on central authorities.\\n\\nHashing takes data of any size and type and returns to you a single, fixed-size \\\"hash\\\" that represents it.\\nA hash is a string of characters that looks like gobbledygook, but you can think of it\\nas a unique name for the data. It might look something like this:\\n\\n`zdpuAsHkamdCQgrDrNSwJVgjMkQWoLxdrccxV6qe9htipNein`\\n\\nTo be honest, these names aren't currently very friendly to humans\\n(`beagle.jpg` was so much more descriptive!), but they're a lot more secure. Here's why:\\n\\n<strong>Cryptographic hashes can be derived from the content of the data itself</strong>,\\nmeaning that anyone using the same algorithm on the same data will arrive at the same hash. If Ada and Grace\\nare both using the same decentralized web protocol, such as IPFS, to share the exact\\nsame photo of a kitten, both images will have exactly the same hash. By comparing\\nthose hashes and confirming that they're the same, we can guarantee that every single pixel\\nof those two photos is identical.\\n\\n<strong>Cryptographic hashes are unique</strong>. If Grace uses Photoshop to remove a\\nsingle whisker from that kitty, the updated image will have a new hash. Simply by looking at that hash, even without access to the file itself, it will\\nbe easy to tell that the file now contains different data.\\n\\n## Trust on the decentralized web\\n\\nOn the centralized web, we've learned to trust certain authorities and not others. We do our best\\nwith the clues we have from URLs, but there are some malicious actors who use the shortcomings of location addressing to trick us.\\n\\nOn the decentralized web, though, we all pitch in and host each other's data, and content addressing enables us to trust the information that's shared. We may not know much about the <em>peers</em> who are hosting data, but hashes can prevent malicious actors from deceiving us about the content of files. That's what makes cryptographic hashing so important to the decentralized web.\\n\\n## Asking peers for content\\n\\nWith traditional location addressing, we knew that we needed to visit the domain `puppies.com` to find the\\ncontent stored as `beagle.jpg`. If the `puppies.com` domain were broken for some reason, we'd lose\\naccess to that image.\\n\\nThe decentralized web works differently. When we want a specific photo of an adorable pet, we ask for it\\nby its content address (hash). Who do we ask? The whole network!

Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance, also known as a node. This IPFS node is not carried over from one lesson to another, which is why you'll see that we often pre-populate some code in a challenge to make the state of your new IPFS node the same as the final state of your node in the previous challenge.\\n\\nWe create these IPFS nodes behind the scenes so that you can focus on the content of each lesson.  Outside of ProtoSchool, though, you'd want a more consistent experience and a node (or multiple nodes) that you could access repeatedly. To achieve this, you could either initialize [js-ipfs in the browser](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/BROWSERS.md) on your own, or host your own node locally by installing IPFS and running a daemon in your terminal. When you're ready to experiment with that, you can visit the IPFS docs site to learn how to [install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/) and [initialize your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/#initialize-the-repository).\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, the methods discussed in this tutorial are part of the IPFS [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md). Check the documentation for more specific details, such as options for each API method.\\n\\n## Add a file\\n\\nIn order to make a file available on the IPFS network, you first need to add it to a specific IPFS node. It's important to remember that because IPFS is a peer-to-peer, decentralized system, adding a file doesn't mean uploading it to a remote server somewhere. Assuming you're using a node on your own machine, the process is more like picking a file from your computer and adding a label to it that says, \\\"I'm shared on IPFS! My name is ______. Come find me!\\\" That label includes a Content Identifier (CID) derived from the file's contents that serves as a type of address that other peers can use to find a specific file, regardless of whose computer it's hosted on.\\n\\nWhen you add a file to IPFS, you're putting it only in your own node, but making it accessible by peers on the network. It will only remain available as long as someone who has it is connected to the network. If no one else has found and shared your file yet, and you shut off your computer or stop your IPFS daemon from running, that content will no longer be available for anyone to discover. The more people who share your content, through a process called pinning, the more likely it is to be available at any one time.\\n\\nLet's take a look at how to add a file to your IPFS node. We'll do this by executing the `add` method:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add(data, [options])\\n```\\n\\nSo if we had the `File` object for an adorable photo of a kitten in our browser, accessible to us via a variable `catPic`, and we wanted to add it to our IPFS node, we could pass it into the `add` method as `data` like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add(catPic)\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `add` method can accept either a single `File` or an array, just in case you have more than one adorable animal photo to add to the node:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add([catPic, dogPic, giraffePic])\\n```\\n\\nBecause the `add` method returns an [`Async Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of), you can only iterate over the values, one by one. If you need to return all the values, you can save each one into an array and then return the array.\\n\\nTo iterate over all the values, we can use a `for await...of` loop:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst result = []\\n\\nfor await (const resultPart of ipfs.add([catPic, dogPic, giraffePic])) {\\n    result.push(resultPart)\\n}\\n\\nreturn result\\n```\\n\\nTo make things easier, we can use the [`it-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/it-all) package that does this automatically:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// the all function comes from the it-all package\\n// and is made globally available (just like ipfs) in our code challenges\\n\\nconst result = await all(ipfs.add([catPic, dogPic, giraffePic]))\\n```\\n\\nThe value of the variable `result` is an array of objects, one for each file added to IPFS, in the following format:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    path: String,\\n    cid: CID,\\n    size: Number,\\n    mode: Number\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe value of the `cid` is a CID object (Content Identifier), a unique address generated from the contents of each file. (For a more in-depth look at how CIDs are generated and why they're important, check out our [Decentralized data structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures) tutorial.) In a future lesson, we will learn how to use this value to retrieve the contents of a file.\\n\\nThe `add` method accepts other `data` formats besides the `File` object and offers many advanced `options` for setting your chunk size and hashing algorithm, pinning files as they're added, and more. We're highlighting the basics in this tutorial, but you can check out the [full documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#add) to learn more.\\n\"","module.exports = \"We've created a text file containing a secret message and stored it on the IPFS network under CID `QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ`.

we exchange data with peers on the decentralized web, we depend on **content addressing** (as opposed to the **location addressing** of the centralized web) to securely locate and identify data. If you haven't yet done so, please check out our [Decentralized Data Structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/) tutorial to learn about the basics of important decentralized web concepts like content addressing, cryptographic hashing, content identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers. In this tutorial we'll dig deep into the anatomy of CIDs, which are constructed from a variety of self-describing values defined by the [Multiformats](https://multiformats.io) project.\\n\\nThe [CID specification](https://github.com/multiformats/cid), which originated in IPFS, now lives in Multiformats and supports a broad range of projects including IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, and Filecoin. Although we'll share some IPFS examples throughout our lessons, this tutorial is about the anatomy of the CID itself, which is used by each of these distributed information systems as the core identifier to reference content.\\n\\nA content identifier, or **CID**, is a self-describing content-addressed identifier. It doesn't indicate _where_ content is stored, but it forms a kind of address based on the content itself. The number of characters in a CID depends on the **cryptographic hash** of the underlying content, rather than the size of the content itself. As most content in IPFS is hashed using `sha2-256`, most CIDs you encounter there will be the same size (256 bits, which equates to 32 bytes). This makes them much easier to manage, especially when dealing with multiple pieces of content.\\n\\nFor example, if we stored an image of an aardvark on the IPFS network, its CID would look like this:  [`QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF)\\n\\nThe first step to creating a CID is to transform the input data, using a **cryptographic algorithm** that maps input of arbitrary size (data or a file) to output of a fixed size. This transformation is known as **cryptographic hash digest** or simply **hash**.\\n\\n![Cryptographic Algorithm infographic](tutorial-assets/T0006L01-crypto-algo-256.png)\\n\\nThe **cryptographic algorithm** used must generate hashes that have the following characteristics:\\n\\n- **Deterministic**: The same input should always produce the same hash.\\n- **Uncorrelated**: A small change in the input should generate a completely different hash.\\n- **One-way**: It should be infeasible to reconstruct the data from the hash.\\n- **Unique**: Only one file can produce one specific hash.\\n\\nNote that if we change a single pixel in our aardvark image, our cryptographic algorithm will generate a completely different hash for the image. When we fetch data using a content address, we're guaranteed to see the intended version of that data. This is quite different from location addressing on the centralized web, where the content at a given address (URL) can change over time.\\n\\nCryptographic hashing is not unique to IPFS, and there are many hashing algorithms out there like `sha2-256`, `blake2b`, `sha3-256` and `sha3-512`, the **no-longer-secure** `sha1` and `md5`, etc. IPFS uses **`sha2-256`** by default, though a CID supports virtually any strong cryptographic hash algorithm.\\n\"","module.exports = \"Create a new blog post which is authored by Sam, has content about `dogs`, and is tagged as `funny` and `hobby`.

Again, the process is very similar to what you may have experienced on\\nthe command line on your own computer.\\n\\nThe MFS method [`files.mkdir`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#filesmkdir) creates a new directory at a specified path. For example, to\\nadd a directory `images` to our root directory ( `/` ), we could do this:\\n\\n```js\\nawait ipfs.files.mkdir('/images')\\n```\\n\\nAn optional `parents` property, which defaults to `false`, specifies whether any\\nparent directories in the given path should be created if they don't already exist.\\nWe didn't need that above, because the new `images` directory was a direct child of an existing\\ndirectory ( `/` ). However, if we instead wanted to created a new directory\\nnested under others that don't yet exist, we'd need to explicitly set the value of\\n`parents` to `true`, like so:\\n\\n```js\\nawait ipfs.files.mkdir('/my/beautiful/images', { parents: true })\\n```\\n\\n*Gotcha!* Although the goal of creating a missing path is similar, notice how we use the `{ parents: true }` option with `files.mkdir` instead of the `{ create: true }` option that was available with `files.write`.\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"app\"}},[_c('router-view',{key:_vm.$route.path})],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","<template>\n  <div id=\"app\">\n    <router-view :key=\"$route.path\"></router-view>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport './styles/index.css'\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'app'\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n\nhtml, body {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\n#app {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  font-family: 'Avenir', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n  color: #2c3e50;\n}\n\n#app > div {\n  height: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\npre {\n  overflow: auto;\n}\n\n.focus-outline:focus {\n  outline: 0;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 0 .2rem rgba(201, 210, 215, .4);\n}\n\n.code, code {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  background-color: rgba(27,31,35,0.05);\n  padding: 0.1rem 0.3rem 0.15rem;\n  margin: 0 -0.1rem;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-family: SFMono-Regular, Monaco, Consolas, \"Liberation Mono\", \"Courier New\", monospace\n}\n\npre code {\n  margin: 0.5rem 0;\n  padding: 0.6rem 0.8rem;\n  display: block;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  overflow: auto;\n}\n\n.fill-current {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./App.vue?vue&type=template&id=930c8f94&\"\nimport script from \"./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./App.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./App.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import data from '../static/projects.json'\n\n// Populate data with more properties\ndata.forEach(project => {\n  project.logo = require(`../static/images/projects/${project.id}.svg`)\n})\n\nfunction get (id) {\n  return getAll().find(project => project.id === id)\n}\n\nfunction getAll () {\n  return data\n}\n\nexport default {\n  get,\n  getAll\n}\n","import marked from 'meta-marked'\nimport moment from 'moment'\n\nimport projects from './projects'\n\n// Load data from the window variable\n// This supports data overriding and custom SSR\nconst tutorialsJson = require('../static/tutorials.json')\nconst tutorials = (window.__DATA__ && window.__DATA__.tutorials) || tutorialsJson\n\n// SET CASING OVERRIDES HERE\n// If a word in a URL would not be appropriate if only the first letter were capitalized,\n// add that word here as a property with the correct capitalization (string) as its value.\n// This is to be used for single words, not full hyphenated paths.

If you use the command line frequently, you're familiar with the `ls` command. IPFS offers a similar `ls` method to list the contents of a directory. However, as with the `cat` method we saw earlier, `ls` will actually look for the requested directory on your own node first, then search the broader network if needed. Because of the way cryptographic hashing works, two directories with identical CIDs are guaranteed to have identical contents, regardless of which peers are hosting them.\\n\\nYou can call the `ls` method like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.ls(ipfsPath)\\n```\\n\\nThe `ipfsPath` argument can take many formats, the simplest of which is a CID. (Remember, that's the same string value we saw returned to us as `cid` when we used the `add` command.) For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.ls(\\\"Qmeybqr2GaiUyGSRWX3dhS2Qz6VTVBXzBiYiFcKpYFJ7tH\\\")\\n```\\n\\nYou can explore other `ipfsPath` formatting options in the [`ls` documentation for the Regular Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#ls).\\n\\nBecause the `ls` method returns an [`Async Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of), you can only iterate over the values, one by one. If you need to return all the values, you can save each one into an array and then return the array.\\n\\nTo iterate over all the values, we can use a `for await...of` loop:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst result = []\\n\\nfor await (const resultPart of ipfs.files.ls('/catPics')) {\\n    result.push(resultPart)\\n}\\n\\nreturn result\\n```\\n\\nTo make things easier, we can use the [`it-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/it-all) package that does this automatically:\\n\\n```javascript\\n// the all function comes from the it-all package\\n// and is made globally available (just like ipfs) in our code challenges\\n\\nconst result = await all(ipfs.files.ls('/catPics'))\\n```\\n\\nThe `result` variable is now an array of objects, one for each file or directory found, structured like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  \\\"cid\\\": Object,\\n  \\\"path\\\": String,\\n  \\\"name\\\": String,\\n  \\\"depth\\\": Number,\\n  \\\"size\\\": Number,\\n  \\\"type\\\": String // can be \\\"file\\\" or \\\"directory\\\",\\n  \\\"mode\\\": Number\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\nNote that there's a different `ls` method in the MFS API (called as `ipfs.files.ls()` rather than `ipfs.ls`) with slightly different properties, which you can learn more about in our MFS tutorial.\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Breadcrumbs.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=547c30cc&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Breadcrumbs.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=547c30cc&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ToggleButton.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=35f2e44c&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ToggleButton.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=35f2e44c&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","module.exports = \"---\\n    title: \\\"Add files in a directory\\\"\\n    type: \\\"file-upload\\\"\\n---\\n\\nWhen we added files to IPFS in Lesson 3, we saw that the `add` method returned `path`, `cid`, and `size` values for each file, and that the `path` and `cid` string values were identical. To access each of these files later, we would need to know its CID. Did you notice that there was no filename provided?\\n\\nThe `add` method does offer one slightly more human-friendly way to refer to files, but only if we use a special `wrapWithDirectory` option to provide a path and filename for the added files. By doing this, we can create both CIDs for individual files, as we saw previously, and a CID for their containing directory, which can be used as part of a path to retrieve those files later by their filenames. This option will allow us to do interesting things with the `ls` and `get` methods, which we'll cover in upcoming lessons.\\n\\nTo use the `wrapWithDirectory` option, you'll need to call the `add` method as follows. Notice that once again we can add either one or multiple files in a single function call.\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add(file, { wrapWithDirectory: true }) // add a single file\\nipfs.add([file1, file2], { wrapWithDirectory: true }) // add multiple files via an array\\n```\\n\\nWhen we used the `add` method previously, we were able to pass in just a `File` object from our browser. However, to wrap files with a directory, we need to also provide a path with the name we want for each file. To do this, we must replace the `file` argument in the `add` method with an object or an array of objects, one for each file, structured like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    path: 'file.txt', // a string for our desired path, including the filename\\n    content: file // in our case, a File object\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo add multiple files at once, we just need to pass an array of objects like the one shown above to the `add` method. For example, we could add two cat pictures into a directory on our IPFS node like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add([\\n    {\\n        path: 'adorable-kitty.jpg',\\n        content: catPic1\\n    },\\n    {\\n        path: 'cat-drinking-milk.jpg',\\n        content: catPic2\\n    }\\n], { wrapWithDirectory: true })\\n```\\n\\nThe `add` method will return information about all the files we've added, as well as details about any directory it had to create in order to correctly add the files in the correct paths. For example, in the case above, the `add` method would return us an array of three elements, one for each file added and another for the wrapping directory created.\\n\\nNote that we could also have used the same `add` method to create one or more subdirectories by adding them to the path of each file. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add([\\n    {\\n        path: 'cats/adorable-kitty.jpg',\\n        content: catPic1\\n    },\\n    {\\n        path: 'cats/cat-drinking-milk.jpg',\\n        content: catPic2\\n    },\\n    {\\n        path: 'dogs/dog-on-a-table.jpg',\\n        content: dogPic1\\n    }\\n], { wrapWithDirectory: true })\\n```\\nIn this case we'd end up with six objects in our resulting array: one for each of the three files added, one for the new wrapping directory, one for the new `cats` directory, and one for the new `dogs` directory.\\n\\n## Directories are immutable\\n\\nIt's important to note that directories we create in this way do not behave as in a regular file system. If we've wrapped some files with a directory with using `add`, we can't simply `add` new files to that directory. The contents of the directory we just created are final and immutable.\\n\\nThis is because of the way in which IPFS uses [content addressing](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/03): different contents lead to a different cryptograhpic hash (Content Identifier), whether we're working with directories or files themselves.\\n\\nBut what if you forgot to add a file to a directory you just created? You'll have to call the `add` method again with all the files you want wrapped with that directory, resulting in a new directory altogether with a new CID.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that the file won't actually be stored multiple times if you do this. Unlike on your computer, where you can accidentally download the same file twice, store it in two different directories, and double your storage needs, the IPFS network inherently knows the contents of a file based on its CID, and can therefore keep only a single copy of the data that the CID refers to. It's only the reference to that data (the CID, which you can think of as a link or an addresses), which is stored in each of the directories you create. This efficiency is one of IPFS's key advantages.\\n\\n**Rather than thinking of directories created with `{ wrapWithDirectory: true }` as traditional file folders, it's more useful to think of them as naming shortcuts, as we'll see in upcoming lessons.**\\n\\n## An alternative\\nIf you're looking for an experience that better mimics a traditional file system, you should explore the [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://proto.school/#/mutable-file-system), a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you. It's an abstraction that lets you deal with immutable data as if it were mutable.\\n\"","module.exports = \"For this last challenge, we've created the following file structure in your IPFS node:\\n\\n```\\n/\\n/shrug.txt\\n/smile.txt\\n/fun/\\n/fun/success.txt\\n```\\n\\nThe CID of the top-level directory is: `\\\"QmcmnUvVV31txDfAddgAaNcNKbrtC2rC9FvkJphNWyM7gy\\\"`\\n\\nUse the `get` method to return data on all of the files and subdirectories contained in the top-level directory.\\n\\n**Hint:** Be sure to return the array created by the `get` method.\\n\"","module.exports = \"Use `ipfs.dag.put` to create a node for the data `{ test: 1 }`.

Whenever you see `ipfs.someMethod()` in our lessons, `ipfs` is a variable that refers to your IPFS instance, also known as a node. The actions that you take only affect your own IPFS node, not nodes belonging to your peers.\\n\\nWe're creating your IPFS node behind the scenes so you can focus on the content of our lessons, but eventually you'll need to learn to host your own node locally by installing IPFS and running a daemon in your terminal. When you're ready to experiment, you can find instructions for [installing IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install/) and [initializing your node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/#initialize-the-repository) in our docs.\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, methods associated with the Mutable File System are part of the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#the-files-api-aka-mfs-the-mutable-file-system), so they'll take the format of `ipfs.files.someMethod()`. Let's take a look at a simple method you can start using even before you've added any files to your IPFS node.\\n\\n## Exploring your IPFS node with `ipfs.files.stat`\\nWhen working with your IPFS node, you'll often want to check the status of a file or directory. You can do this with [`ipfs.files.stat`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#filesstat), passing in the path you'd like to check on.\\n\\nFor example, to check the status of a directory called `stuff` located within our root directory ( `/` ), we could call the method like so:\\n\\n````javascript\\nawait ipfs.files.stat('/stuff')\\n```\\n\\nThis method returns an object with some essential data about our file or directory:\\n\\n* **cid** (the CID object)\\n* **size** (an integer with the file or directory size in Bytes)\\n* **cumulativeSize** (an integer with the size of the DAGNodes making up the file in Bytes)\\n* **type** (a string that can be either `directory` or `file`)\\n* **blocks** (if type is `directory`, this is the number of files in the directory; if type is `file`, it's the number of blocks that make up the file)\\n* **withLocality** (a boolean to indicate if locality information are present)\\n* **local** (a boolean to indicate if the queried dag is fully present locally)\\n* **sizeLocal** (an integer indicating the cumulative size of the data present locally)\\n\\n*Gotcha!* The `size` of a directory is always `0`, no matter how many entries it contains, since directories are really just a set of links to other files and directories. A directory's `cumulativeSize`, by contrast, changes as the directory's contents change. It represents not just the file sizes of all the entries in that directory, but also the metadata that describes those entries: types, block sizes and so on.\\n\\nIt's important to note that you can `stat` your IPFS node even when you don't have anything in it yet. Even an empty node has a CID.\\n\"","import { logFiles } from '../../utils/files'\n\nconst validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  if (!result) {\n    return { fail: 'Looks like you forgot to return a result.

They make it possible for us to create links and connect data on the web, so they serve a valuable purpose. (The web would be pretty lousy without links!) However, <strong>URLs are based on the <em>location</em> where data is stored</strong>, not on the contents of the resource stored there. We call this <strong>location addressing</strong>, and it presents us with some problems.\\n\\nMost of us have a lot of experience with URLs, and we make some assumptions about them based on our experience. When we see  `https://www.puppies.com/beagle.jpg`, for example, we'll probably guess from the file name and extension that the data stored at that location is an image of a beagle (in JPEG format), but we can't verify this from the URL alone. There may very well be a photo of a chihuahua hiding at `beagle.jpg`, or even worse, an adorable kitty!\\n\\nThrough the domain name, URLs indicate which *authority* we should go to for the data. Even though the web is already decentralized in a sense (since anyone can link to anyone else), the links referencing the data are location-based, so the data itself must be centralized on an authority in order for us to find it. We make assumptions about these authorities (or domains), just as we do with file names. For example, we might assume that a file hosted at `puppies.com` is safer to open than one hosted at `evilhacker.com`, but we can't be sure of it.\\n\\nUltimately, the contents of a file hosted on the centralized web have no direct relationship with their location-based addresses. If we see a picture of an adorable puppy and are told it's stored on the web, there's no way for us to guess the URL that would lead us to the image. We can determine neither the domain, which tells us who's hosting it, nor the filename.\\n\\n## Trust and efficiency on the centralized web\\nSince we can't verify what content resides at a particular URL and are dependent on central authorities (and human kindness) to label things as they really are, it's easy for us to get tricked by malicious actors.\\n\\nIt's also easy for 42,000 people to store exactly the same photo of that adorable beagle, but all on different domains and with different filenames, leading to a lot of redundancy. Let's face it, even on our own laptops most of us have accidentally saved the same document as `download.pdf` and `download(01).pdf` without realizing it, or saved iterations of the same term paper over and over again with `v1` or `2018-12-18` added to the title. The web is a confusing mess of data that's saved multiple times at different URLs, and there's no easy way to tell which items are identical to each other.\\n\\nThere must be a better way!\\n\"","module.exports = \"In the code below, introduce a new field named `prev` in our blog posts.

Example:\\n\\n`bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`\\n\\nConverting data between binary and string formats requires base encoding, so when working with string CIDs it's important that we know the type of base encoding that was applied to the binary data.

All hashes that start with `Qm` can safely be interpreted as `base58btc` as a CID of Version 0.\\n\\nThe second example starts with `b`, the base encoding prefix identifier for `base32`, which is used by default by most implementations of IPFS.\\n\\nFor the complete list of `multibase` identifiers, see [this table](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/multibase.csv).\\n\"","module.exports = \"Let's see `files.ls` in action!

The CID Inspector has offered us a conversion from CIDv0 to CIDv1.\\n\\nNotice also how the end of the \\\"Human Readable CID\\\" (the portion after the prefixes) is exactly the same in this CIDv0 example as it was in the CIDv1 example: `c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`.\\n\\nWhy? These two CIDs point to the same content. Basically, it's the same hash (`c3c4733ec8affd06cf9e9ff50ffc6bcd2ec85a6170004bb709669c31de94391a`) represented in the two different versions of the CID spec.\\n\\n## Converting CID versions\\n\\nYou can convert any `CIDv0` to `CIDv1`, because the implicit prefixes from `v0` become explicit in `v1`.\\nHowever, because `CIDv1` supports multiple codecs and multiple bases and `CIDv0` does not, not all `CIDv1` can be converted to `CIDv0`. In fact, only `CIDv1` that have the following properties can be converted to `CIDv0`:\\n\\n- `multibase = base58btc`\\n- `multicodec = dag-pb`\\n- `multihash-algorithm = sha2-256`\\n- `multihash-length = 32` (32 bytes, equivalent to 256 bits)\\n\\nTo test this theory, you can check out our beloved aardvark image here, hosted on the IPFS network: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF\\n\\n- Open the link in your browser and copy the CID from the end of the URL (`QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLj9Zm1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF`)\\n- In a new browser window, paste it into the [CID Inspector tool](https://cid.ipfs.io) and find the equivalent CIDv1 value displayed at the bottom of the screen\\n- Back in your aardvark tab, replace the `v0` CID with the converted `v1` CID in the original URL and refresh the page\\n\\nYou should see the same image of our aardvark.\\n\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/in-progress.774a81c8.svg\";","import shallowEqualArrays from 'shallow-equal/arrays'\nimport CID from 'cids'\n\nconst validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  if (!result) {\n    return { fail: 'No result was returned.

This allows us to easily read the contents of a `.txt` file among others.\\n\\nThe method takes this format:\\n\\n```js\\nipfs.files.read(path, [options])\\n```\\n\\nThe `path` provided is the path of the file to read, and it must point to a file rather than a directory.\\n\\nThe `files.read` method returns an Async Iterable that iterates over the file's chunks of data, i.e. Buffers. In our case, we ultimately need to convert Buffers into strings using the method `toString()`. However, the chunks of data within a single file need to be reassembled (concatenated) before the conversion. The [`it-to-buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/it-to-buffer) package can iterate over all of the chunks and put them back together for us. (We've made this package availabe to you in our challenges as `toBuffer`.)\\n\\n```js\\n// the toBuffer variable is globally available (just like ipfs)\\n\\nlet bufferedContents = await toBuffer(ipfs.files.read('/directory/some-file.txt'))  // a buffer\\nlet contents = bufferedContents.toString() // a string\\n```\\n\\nWhen you're ready to try this in the real world, you should note that the above example can result in heavy memory usage, depending on the contents of the file being read. If you're working with large files and find this to be the case, you might want to skip using the `it-to-buffer` package and instead process each chunk of data iteratively. The main reason IPFS now returns `Async Iterables` is to provide a built-in option for dealing with potential performance issues.\\nIn ProtoSchool tutorials, our code challenges use small files, so we can concatenate everything without worrying about performance.\\n\"","/*\n  Set of utils to help build validation code\n\n  - format: format data to display in the output UI\n  - ipfs: helpers related to js-ipfs\n  - validators: set of common validators\n  - validationMessages: set of common validation messages\n */\n\nimport * as format from './format'\nimport * as ipfs from './ipfs'\nimport * as validators from './validators'\nimport validationMessages from './validation-messages'\n\nexport default {\n  format,\n  ipfs,\n  validators,\n  validationMessages\n}\n","module.exports = \"Let's add some files to IPFS using MFS.

As its full name suggests, you can think of IPFS as a file system, and it has some unique characteristics that make it ideal for safe, decentralized sharing.\\n\\nIf you haven't yet done so, we encourage you to check out our [Decentralized Data Structures tutorial](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/), where you can learn all about the decentralized web and how it compares to the web you're accustomed to. There you'll learn all about content addressing, cryptographic hashing, Content Identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers, all of which you'll need to understand to make the most of this tutorial on IPFS.\\n\\n## Storing and sharing data in IPFS\\n\\nWhere does content live when it's added to the IPFS network?\\n\\nAs a peer-to-peer data storage system, IPFS allows each user (peer) to host whatever data they'd like locally. When you first add new content to IPFS, you're really just setting it up on your own machine in a format suitable for sharing via the IPFS protocol. Typically you'd install IPFS on your own computer and create a new instance of IPFS (also known as a node) there. That's where your data would live locally, referenced by content addresses (CIDs). Data stored in IPFS can take many forms, but one of the most common use cases is the sharing of traditional files, which we'll learn more about in this tutorial.\\n\\nYou could choose to share your data or files with your peers when you had a network connection, but if you were the only one hosting a particular resource, it would become unavailable to your peers when your machine went offline. Having multiple peers hosting the same files is what makes them more readily available, and using CIDs (unique content identifiers created through cryptograhpic hashing) is what makes this system secure. We'll talk more about sharing in future tutorials, but for now we'll focus on how to work with files within your own IPFS instance.\\n\\n## Mutable File System\\n\\nBecause files in IPFS are content-addressed and immutable, you can't edit files; instead, a new file is created with every change. The **Mutable File System (MFS)** is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem — you can add, remove, move, and edit MFS files and have all the work of updating links and hashes taken care of for you. It's an abstraction that lets you deal with immutable data as if it were mutable.\\n\\nMFS is accessed through the `files` commands in the IPFS CLI (command-line interface) and API. In this tutorial we'll explore the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#the-files-api-aka-mfs-the-mutable-file-system).\\n\\nIf you've worked with files and directories from the command line before, many of the MFS methods will look very familiar!\\n\\nLet's start exploring how we can work with files in IPFS!\\n\"","module.exports = \"---\\n    title: \\\"Get all of the files in a directory\\\"\\n    type: \\\"code\\\"\\n---\\n\\nNeed to know more about an IPFS file or directory beyond just its contents? Whereas `cat` retrieves just the buffered content of a file, we can access additional metadata about a file or directory by calling the `get` method like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.get(ipfsPath)\\n```\\n\\nThe result is an array of objects, one per file or directory, with the following structure:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n    cid: Object,\\n    name: String,\\n    path: String,\\n    depth: Number,\\n    size: Number,\\n    type: String, //can be \\\"file\\\" or \\\"dir\\\"\\n    content: Buffer, // only exists if the type === \\\"file\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs with `cat` and `ls`, the `get` method will search for the requested file or directory on the IPFS network if it can't find it on your local node.\\n\\n## The use case for `get` versus `cat` or `ls`\\n\\n#### Returning both metadata and content\\n\\nThe `get` method returns metadata for all files and subdirectories, as well as content for all files.\\n\\nNotice that the data returned by `get` (as shown above) is structured almost identically to the result of the `ls` method, except that we now see contents returned (if the target is a file) _in addition to_ metadata.\\n\\nIn the case of a file, `get` returns metadata _in addition to_ the buffered content we could have retrieved using `cat`.\\n\\nJust like `ls`, `get` will return an Async Iterable, so we still need to use the `it-all` package on its return value.\\n\\n```javascript\\nawait all(ipfs.get(ipfsPath))\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Returning directory contents recursively\\n\\nAnother very important distinction between `get` and these other methods is that, when run on a directory, it will retrieve contents **recursively**, meaning that the resulting array will contain an entry for the specified directory itself as well as every subdirectory and every file present inside the specified directory, even those inside of subdirectories.\\n\\nBy contrast, the `ls` method returns an array with metadata only for the top-level contents within the specified directory (whether files or subdirectories). It doesn't return an entry for the specified directory itself and it doesn't return entries for the contents of subdirectories.\\n\\nThe `get` method can:\\n\\n- Recursively retrieve every file and subdirectory in a directory\\n- Tell us which entries are directories and which are files\\n- Inform us of the size of a file\\n- Pinpoint the depth of a file in the directory structure\\n- and offer many other details\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lesson.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=150ef536&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lesson.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=150ef536&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","module.exports = \"---\\n    title: \\\"Introducing the Files API\\\"\\n    type: \\\"text\\\"\\n---\\n\\n## IPFS: The InterPlanetary File System\\n\\n[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol used to share data on the distributed web. You can think of it as a file system with some unique characteristics that make it ideal for safe, decentralized sharing.\\n\\nIf you haven't yet done so, we encourage you to check out our [Decentralized Data Structures](https://proto.school/#/data-structures/) tutorial to learn all about the decentralized web and how it compares to the web you're accustomed to. There you'll learn all about content addressing, cryptographic hashing, Content Identifiers (CIDs), and sharing with peers, all of which you'll need to understand to make the most of this tutorial.\\n\\n## The Files API vs the DAG API\\n\\nYou can store multiple types of data with IPFS. If you've explored our [P2P Data Links with Content Addressing](https://proto.school/#/basics) or [Blogging on the Decentralized Web](https://proto.school/#/blog) tutorial, you've already seen how you can store primitives, objects and arrays on the network using the DAG API.\\n\\nThe DAG API allows you to use the unique and versatile primitive data structures offered by [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld) (InterPlanetary Linked Data) within IPFS. You can recognize its methods in js-ipfs (the JavaScript implementation of IPFS) because they take the following format: `ipfs.dag.someMethod()`\\n\\nThe DAG API is the most generic and flexible approach to adding data to the IPFS node, but it's not the most efficient when it comes to the very common use case of sharing files. What if you wanted to share a picture of a kitten, or a larger file like a funny video of your favorite celebrity dog? How would you add these files to the network and provide a way for your friends to see them? How should each file be placed in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in a single block or split into chunks? These are optimization details that fall beyond the scope of the DAG API. Though it would be possible to use the DAG API to add files to an IPFS node, it would be a labor-intensive task.\\n\\nThe Files API, on the other hand, is custom-built for a more specific use case. The Files API prepares files to be placed in the network and ensures that IPFS knows how to access them and handle them efficiently. The Files API is made of two parts: the Regular Files API, which we'll cover in this tutorial, and the Mutable File System (MFS).\\n\\n## The Regular Files API vs the MFS Files API\\n\\nIf you've read our [Mutable File System tutorial](https://proto.school/#/mutable-file-system), you may be thinking, \\\"I've already learned how to work with files on IPFS. How will this be any different?\\\"\\n\\nThe Mutable File System (MFS) provides an API designed to replicate familiar file system operations such as `mkdir`, `ls`, `cp`, and others, mimicking the way you organize files and directories on a computer. However, the way that content is addressed in IPFS makes it an immutable file system. The address to a file or directory depends on its contents, so any change to a file or directory will result in an entirely new address. The MFS Files API works on a familiar-looking file system with regular paths — like `/some/stuff` — in the local IPFS node, which hides the complexity of immutable content addressing.\\n\\nAlthough MFS is very useful, the abstraction it provides hides some of the inner workings of IPFS. The Regular Files API we will discuss here is instead a bare bones approach to managing files in IPFS. It trades the powerful abstractions of MFS for a scheme which helps you understand what is actually happening in the file system. In the Regular Files API you'll find methods like `add`, `cat`, `get` and `ls`.\\n\\nUnlike the MFS API, which can be recognized in js-ipfs by the format `ipfs.files.someMethod()`, the Regular Files API uses top-level methods that take the format `ipfs.someMethod()`.\\n\\nThe distinction between these two versions of the Files APIs is a bit confusing at the moment, but the IPFS team is currently working on revamping them to make the whole Files API more user-friendly. We'll be sure to update our tutorials when things change!\\n\"","module.exports = \"First, you'll need to add a link to the new blog from the node for the `hobby` tag.\\n\\nWe don't yet have a node for the `funny` tag.

However, now that we've learned we can wrap a number of files into a directory, we have a new way to address a file.\\n\\nAs you saw in our lesson on the [`wrapWithDirectory` option](https://proto.school/#/file-api/05), we can add one or more files to a new directory and, when doing so, we need to provide a name to each one of the files we add. As a result, the `add` method call returns us an array which contains the `cid` value for each of the files and directories created.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, it's useful to think of directories created with `{ wrapWithDirectory: true }` as naming shortcuts, rather than as traditional file folders. Here's why:\\n\\nImagine that we called the `add` method like this, in order to add two files wrapped by a directory...\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.add([\\n    {\\n        path: 'lists/kitty-pic-list.txt',\\n        content: catList\\n    },\\n    {\\n        path: 'cat-drinking-milk.jpg',\\n        content: catPic\\n    }\\n], { wrapWithDirectory: true })\\n```\\n\\n...and that the `add` method returned this result:\\n\\n```javascript\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"path\\\": \\\"lists/kitty-pic-list.txt\\\",\\n    \\\"cid\\\": CID('Qmey7KyqDwo8BfAoVsyLbybQ8LTN3RGbvvY1zV5PeumTLV'),\\n    \\\"size\\\": 19021\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"path\\\": \\\"lists\\\",\\n    \\\"cid\\\": CID('QmPT14mWCteuybfrfvqas2L2oin1Y2NCbwzTh9cc33GF1t'),\\n    \\\"size\\\": 1093102\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"path\\\": \\\"cat-drinking-milk.jpg\\\",\\n    \\\"cid\\\": CID('QmexwNKUeJPmmNR7n4wSzQXrVuyeuQcQikHCHg5xM3mtRq'),\\n    \\\"size\\\": 912035\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"path\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"cid\\\": CID('QmP1j6shbCikCSfnQR7MzJrYdgM6ALpXJAUvkGJFrrwNew'),\\n    \\\"size\\\": 1181341\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\nTo read the contents of the `kitty-pic-list.txt` file, we would now have four addressing options:\\n\\n* Using the file's own unique `cid`, as we've done previously:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.cat(\\\"Qmey7KyqDwo8BfAoVsyLbybQ8LTN3RGbvvY1zV5PeumTLV\\\")\\n```\\n\\n* Using the file's full IPFS path (note how `/ipfs/` has been prepended to the CID):\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.cat(\\\"/ipfs/Qmey7KyqDwo8BfAoVsyLbybQ8LTN3RGbvvY1zV5PeumTLV\\\")\\n```\\n\\n* Using an IPFS path that includes the `cid` of the file's containing directory (`lists`) and the file's path relative to that directory:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.cat(\\\"/ipfs/QmPT14mWCteuybfrfvqas2L2oin1Y2NCbwzTh9cc33GF1t/kitty-pic-list.txt\\\")\\n```\\n\\n* Using an IPFS path that includes the `cid` of the top-level directory and the file's path relative to that directory:\\n\\n```javascript\\nipfs.cat(\\\"/ipfs/QmP1j6shbCikCSfnQR7MzJrYdgM6ALpXJAUvkGJFrrwNew/lists/kitty-pic-list.txt\\\")\\n```\\n\\nThese last two options allow us to include human-readable filenames in IPFS paths, and therefore offer an interesting reason why we might choose to use the `wrapWithDirectory` option even if we're only adding a single file.\\n\\nNotice that whenever we use an IPFS path (and not just a CID) to reference a file, it's important that we include `/ipfs/` at the start. This is necessary because there are other networking protocols that use the same CIDs but have different path structures, like libp2p or IPNS.\\n\"","const question = 'If we have two different CIDs pointing to the same content, doesn\\'t that break the \"uniqueness\" rule specified in the first lesson?'\n\nconst choices = [\n  {\n    answer: 'Yes, because CIDv0 and CIDv1 are not compatible.',\n    correct: false,\n    feedback: 'Actually, all CIDs in Version 0 can be converted to be represented in Version 1, and both versions would have something important in common.'\n  },\n  {\n    answer: 'No, because the two CIDs are just two different version representations of the same hash.

Since file objects in the browser are a kind of Blob, we're good to go!\\n\\nEven though the file object in the browser happens to know its own filename, Blobs in general don't, so IPFS can't determine the existing filename directly. We'll have to provide the desired filename as part of the `path`.\\n\\nThe `path` is a new path you'd like to create within your IPFS instance, including the desired filename. (Note that it's the destination path we're describing, _not_ the path where the file already resides on your computer.)\\n\\nThe MFS `files.write` method, like similar methods you may have used on your own computer, is actually built for editing the content of an existing file. However, we can also use it to create a brand new file by providing the boolean option `{ create: true }` to indicate that a file should be created at the given path if it doesn't already exist there.\\n\\nSo if we had a file object in our browser, accessible via a variable `catPic`, and we wanted to add it to our root directory on IPFS and have it be named `cat.jpg`, we could do it like so:\\n\\n```js\\nawait ipfs.files.write('/cat.jpg', catPic, { create: true })\\n```\\n\\nIf we needed to, we could have used concatenation (the joining together of strings) to create that same path. This comes in handy if your filename is a property of your file object, as is true in the browser.\\n\\n```js\\nawait ipfs.files.write('/' + catPic.name, catPic, { create: true })\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `files.write` method does not provide a return value.\\n\\nLater on we'll look at how to add files to directories other than the root directory.\\n\"","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/close.f9029ae6.svg\";","import all from 'it-all'\n\nimport utils from '../utils'\n\nconst validate = async (result, ipfs) => {\n  const uploadedFiles = window.uploadedFiles || false\n\n  const iterable = ipfs.add(window.uploadedFiles)\n  const expectedResult = await all(iterable)\n\n  if (!result) {\n    return {\n      fail: utils.validationMessages.NO_RESULT\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (result.error) {\n    return { error: result.error }\n  }\n\n  if (utils.validators.isAsyncIterable(result)) {\n    return {\n      fail: utils.validationMessages.VALUE_IS_ASYNC_ITERABLE_ALL\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (!Array.isArray(result)) {\n    return {\n      fail: 'The returned value should be an array.'\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (result.length > uploadedFiles.length) {\n    return {\n      fail: 'The array you returned has more items than the number of files you uploaded.
